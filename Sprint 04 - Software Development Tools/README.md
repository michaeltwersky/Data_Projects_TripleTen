# Data Analysis of Vehicles

## Description

This project creates a web app, accessible to the public, that analyzes and plots data on car sales. 

It begins by making a local python environment, performing EDA of vehicle sales data using VS Code, pushing it to GitHub, and finally launching via the render service.

The EDA and plots in this project utilize the following python libraries:

1. streamlit
2. pandas
3. plotly express
4. numpy

## Instructions to run locally

1. Fork this repository
2. Clone the repository in GitHub and then clone it to your local machine
3. Install the above packages and streamlit using the command line
4. Download the dataset
5. Run `streamlit run app.py` command from local terminal
