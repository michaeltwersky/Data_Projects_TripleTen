# Task 5

For each hour, retrieve the weather condition records from the weather_records table. Using the CASE operator, break all hours into two groups: Bad if the description field contains the words rain or storm, and Good for others. Name the resulting field weather_conditions. The final table must include two fields: date and hour (ts) and weather_conditions.
```
SELECT
    DATE_TRUNC('hour', ts) AS ts,
CASE
    WHEN description LIKE '%rain%' OR description LIKE '%storm%' THEN 'Bad'
    ELSE 'Good'
END AS weather_conditions

```

# Task 6
Retrieve from the trips table all the rides that started in the Loop (pickup_location_id: 50) on a Saturday and ended at O'Hare (dropoff_location_id: 63). Get the weather conditions for each ride. Use the method you applied in the previous task. Also, retrieve the duration of each ride. Ignore rides for which data on weather conditions is not available.
```
SELECT
    start_ts,
CASE
    WHEN description LIKE '%rain%' or description like '%storm%' THEN 'Bad'
    ELSE 'Good'
END AS weather_conditions,

    trips
    INNER JOIN weather_records ON weather_records.ts = trips.start_ts
WHERE
    EXTRACT(DOW from trips.start_ts) = 6
    AND pickup_location_id = 50 AND dropoff_location_id = 63
    AND description IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    trip_id;
