# Basic Python: Project

## Introduction

In this project, you will work with data from the entertainment industry. You will study a dataset with records on movies and shows. The research will focus on the “Golden Age” of television, which began in 1999 with the release of The Sopranos and is still ongoing.

## Goal

The aim of this project is to investigate how the number of votes a title receives from IMDb users impacts its ratings. The assumption is that highly-rated shows (we will focus on TV shows, ignoring movies) released during the “Golden Age” of television also have the most votes.

## Description of the Data

Description of columns:

- `name` — first and last name of actor (director)
- `character` — character played (for actors)
- `role` — the person’s contribution to the title (it can be in the capacity either of 
actor or director)
- `title` — title of movie (show)
- `type` — show or movie
- `genres` — list of genres under which the movie (show) falls
- `release_year` — year when the movie (show) was released
- `imdb_score` — score on IMDb
- `imdb_votes` — votes on IMDb
