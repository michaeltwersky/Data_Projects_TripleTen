# Computer Vision

## Introduction

The supermarket chain Good Seed would like to explore whether Data Science can help them adhere to alcohol laws by making sure they do not sell alcohol to people underage.


- The shops are equipped with cameras in the checkout area which are triggered when a person is buying alcohol
- Computer vision methods can be used to determine age of a person from a photo

## Goal

Build and evaluate a model for verifying a person's age.

## Description of the Data

The dataset is composed of two tables. 

1. `final_files` - includes 7.6k photos

2. `labels.cvs`
   - `file_name`
   - `real_age`

## Tools

- Python
  - Pandas
  - Numpy
  - Tensorflow
  - MatPlotLib
  - Keras
