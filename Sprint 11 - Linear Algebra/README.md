# Linear Algebra

## Introduction

The Sure Tomorrow insurance company wants to solve several tasks with the help of Machine Learning, and you are asked to evaluate that possibility.

- Task 1: Find customers who are similar to a given customer. This will help the company's agents with marketing.

- Task 2: Predict whether a new customer is likely to receive an insurance benefit. Can a 
trained prediction model do better than an untrained dummy model? Can it do worse? Explain your logic.

- Task 3: Predict the number of insurance benefits a new customer is likely to receive using a linear regression model.

- Task 4: Protect clients' personal data without breaking the model from the previous task.

## Goal

Develop a data transformation algorithm that would make it hard to recover personal information if the data fell into the wrong hands. This is called data masking, or data obfuscation. But the data should be protected in such a way that the quality of machine learning models doesn't suffer.
