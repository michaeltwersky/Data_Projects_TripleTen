# Machine Learning for Texts

## Introduction

The Film Junky Union, a new edgy community for classic movie enthusiasts, is developing a system for filtering and categorizing movie reviews.

## Goal

Train a model to automatically detect negative movie reviews.

## Description of the Data

The dataset is one of IMBD movie reviews with polarity labelling to build a model for classifying positive and negative reviews.

Stored in one table, the `imdb_reviews.tsv` dataset contains:

- `review` - review text
- `pos` - **target**, '0' for a negative review and '1' for a positive review
- `ds_part` - 'train'/'test' for the train/test parts of the dataset, correspondingly

*The data was provided by Andrew L. Maas, Raymond E. Daly, Peter T. Pham, Dan Huang, Andrew Y. Ng, and Christopher Potts. (2011). Learning Word Vectors for Sentiment Analysis. The 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2011).*
