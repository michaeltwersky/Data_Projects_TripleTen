## Introduction

You work for the OilyGiant mining company. Your task is to find the best place for a new well.

Steps to choose the location:

- Collect the oil well parameters in the selected region: oil quality and volume of reserves;
- Build a model for predicting the volume of reserves in the new wells;
- Pick the oil wells with the highest estimated values;
- Pick the region with the highest total profit for the selected oil wells.

You have data on oil samples from three regions.

## Goal

Build a model that will help to pick the region with the highest profit margin. Analyze potential profit and risks using the Bootstrapping technique.a

## Description of the Data

Spread across three files, each representing a region:

- `id` - unique oil well identifier
- `f0`, `f1`, `f2` - three features of points (their specific meaning is unimportant, but the features themselves are significant
- `product` - volume of reserves in the oil well (thousand barrels)
